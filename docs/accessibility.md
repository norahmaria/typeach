# Accessibility

**The entire point of this component library is to provide accessible components - but I am not at all an accessibility expert and this is mostly about me learning accessibility.** You're better off using something tried-and-tested and created by people way smarter than I am - like [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/v1/vue) or [Radix Vue](https://www.radix-vue.com).

::: info BASED ON APG
The components are mostly based on different [WAI Aria APG Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/), and sometimes modified based on what I find while doing research. If there isn't an appropriate APG pattern for a component, you'll find links to the references used in the documentation for it.

I try my best to research every component - and I started making this mostly as a way for me to learn more about accessibility, but after a couple components, I realized how many components I'd end up making, and that the resources I've gathered up might be useful - so I thought it was worth putting somewhere public.

If you spot any issues at all - _please_ create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/norahmaria/typeach/issues) to address your concern. Or, if you know better than I do - feel free to contribute ðŸ’š

## Resources

<b>I provide links to the articles and resources I found most insightful or helpful for every component in their documentation.</b> Some of the components I didn't start documenting until after, so there's a couple components that just refer to their APG article.

Below are some of the blogs and sites I found myself referencing like crazy for almost any component while looking for accessibility guidelines and best practices.

- [WAI Aria APG Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
- [Scott O'Hara's blog](https://www.scottohara.me)
