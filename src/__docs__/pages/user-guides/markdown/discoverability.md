It's important that people find your user guides. Links to get help or to read the manual should be one of the first links on your site, similar to a [skip to main content link](https://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/it-accessibility-at-nc-state/developers/accessibility-handbook/mouse-and-keyboard-events/skip-to-main-content/). You should also provide a keyboard shortcut to access the guide.

_This article is a work in progress._ Might take a while as I'm hoping to provide some components and helper functions to help with documenting components.
